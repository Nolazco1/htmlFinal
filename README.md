 Goal: Create an HTML file that will be styled differently three times, using one of three different CSS style sheets that you will create. If you like, you can use the base file that's provided here. 
Download the zipped file below, then right-click and "Extract All" (there will be only one file when you extract, and that is the base HTML5 template available for your use). Your HTML files should use the HTML5 Doctype and meta tag (as does the optional base file we provide for you here). 

Final Project Directions:
It is possible to style the entire document using only div and span elements that have been given appropriate id and class values.
If you like, you are allowed to add the additional elements such as: div span p h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 ul ol li dl dt dd img br hr a
Start by altering the HTML file by inserting DIV, SPAN, and (optionally) other elements, using them to help define the structure of your page. Use classes and id's to selectively detail page elements, and save the CSS to an external CSS file that has been linked (using the link element) to this HTML file.  ALL placement, positioning, coloring, etc. MUST be done using that page's linked stylesheet.

If you choose to build your own HTML template,  it must have 2 navigation menus (to identical destinations) similar to the page provided. One menu should be located as a main menu, the other near the bottom, as a basic text menu, similar to projects you've worked on.
When you've finished your first styled page, copy the HTML file, and make two more versions of that EXACT page (the only things that should change from the first HTML page to the second and third pages will be the name of the CSS file that you are linking to that is styling the HTML page, and the design number that you'll change in the title tags). We highly recommend you name your files so that they can be easily identified, such as: 

    final1.html --> which will link to --> final1.css
    final2.html --> which will link to --> final2.css
    final3.html --> which will link to --> final3.css 

When you are finished, VALIDATE all of your HTML and CSS. When they all pass validation, zip all of your files up (you should have 3 .html and 3 .css files) and attached the zipped file in Canvas. If your styles include images and/or background images, be sure to include them when you zip your project up. Remember -- All three of your HTML files must be IDENTICAL, with the exception of the href value in the link element that determines which style sheet is being used. If you have any questions, be sure to contact an instructor.
